# Notion Minder Extension

A simple, offline-first browser extension to help you stay mindful and journal your thoughts directly to a Notion database. It provides context-aware reminders when you're on user-defined "shallow work" websites, prompting you for a quick reflection.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Before you can use the extension, you need to configure it to connect to your Notion workspace.

1.  **Get Your Notion API Key**:

      - Go to [notion.so/my-integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations).
      - Create a new integration and copy the "Internal Integration Secret" key.

2.  **Get Your Notion Database ID**:

      - Create a new Database in Notion for your journal entries.
      - Click the **"..."** menu on your new database and **"Add connection"**, selecting the integration you just created.
      - Go to the database page in your browser. The URL will look like `notion.so/your-workspace/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx?v=...`.
      - The **Database ID** is the 32-character part of the URL before the `?`.

3.  **Configure the Extension**:

      - Right-click the Notion Minder extension icon in your toolbar and select **Options**.
      - Paste your **Notion API Key** and **Journal Database ID** into the respective fields.
      - Add any websites you want to trigger reminders under the **Shallow Work Sites** section (one per line).
      - Click **Save Settings**.

You are now ready to use the extension\!

### üîí A Note on Security

This extension is designed to be private and offline-first. Your Notion API key is stored **only** in your browser's local, sandboxed storage (`chrome.storage.local`). It is never transmitted to any server other than Notion's official API when you save an entry.

This is a too early version of the extension. I will be updating it soon with more features and a better user interface.
